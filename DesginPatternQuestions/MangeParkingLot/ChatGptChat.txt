lets start a lld interview.
Where the level lets keep bit easy.
And you job is it to be as abstract as possible, becuase I want to learn to gather as much information needed.
You are not suppose to summarize it. and no need to dive deep into it.
Just see whether i am able to go properly or not.
and yes Please dont give hints and examples just be abstract as much as possible.
Understood


ChatGPT said:
Understood. I’ll keep the problem abstract, avoid hints or examples, and let you drive the discussion.
Let’s begin.

Design a system for managing a parking lot.


You said:
Okay
Hi, I will start by giving a scenario


ChatGPT said:
Go ahead. I'm listening.

You said:
1) Will have an entracte and exit gate
2) When a vehicle comes, the system will generate a ticket
3) where teh ticker will contains -> Where to park based on the type of the vehicle
4) When the vehicle exits, the parking lot becomes free
5) We will have monitor in which the availibility is shown

am I going in the right direction, do we require any other scenrio in this


ChatGPT said:
You're heading in the right direction by identifying key components and their responsibilities. The scenario covers core flow: entry, ticket generation, parking allocation, exit, and availability display.

Before proceeding, you might consider probing into these dimensions (no need to answer yet, just check if you’ve thought about them):

Variability: Are there different kinds of parking slots or vehicles?

Constraints: Any limits on parking duration or priority rules?

Stakeholders: Who operates or monitors the system?

Errors: What if a slot isn’t available?

Persistence: Does data need to be stored across sessions?

Would you like to refine the scenario further or move on to identifying core components?



You said:
Sure
1) Variablity: YEs, for not lets assume only 3 kind of vehicles-> Two wheeler, four wheeler and 3 wheeler
2) Constrainnts: Yes there will be constrint of each vehicle parking size (say 10 for now)
3) stakeHolders: We will have a parking manager who manges the allotment and payment of the ticker and parking.
4) Errors: If spaces are filled then no need to generate ticket and all
5) Yes for now we will have repository which contains some kind of data structure to save this data


ChatGPT said:
Good. You've added the right kind of depth to your scenario — you're surfacing variability, constraints, roles, failures, and persistence, which are all essential perspectives.

You're well-positioned now to:

Identify the main entities and their responsibilities

Define how they interact

Decide where business logic lives

Let me know when you're ready to move forward with that.



You said:
Okay,
The main entities which I think this contains are
1) Vehicle
2) Parking space
3) Parking lot
4) entrance gate
5) exit gate
6) Ticket

additional entities:
1) VehicleType (enum) -> Two wheeler, four wheeler, three wheeler

Roles:
1) Vehicle: id, plate no, vehicle type
2) ParkingSpace: id, Vehicle type
3) Parking Lot(Singelton) : Contains list of parking space, list of entrace gate and list of exit gate
4) Entrance gate: responsible to search the parking space for a particular vehicle and generate ticket
5) Exit gate: responsible to calculate price based on the time and free the parking space.
-> This exit gate uses a strategy patterns to calculate price where the price differs based on the vehicle.
6) Ticket: contains the vehicle type, parking id, entrance time.
7) ParkingManager: Responsible for adding parking space, and removing parking space. Search for parking parking space which will be initiated by the entrance gate.


So this is how i am thinking


ChatGPT said:
You're on the right path. You've clearly defined core entities, their roles, and how responsibilities are distributed — especially separating concerns between entrance/exit and ParkingManager.

This abstraction level is solid. A few things to consider (again, not answering, just suggesting lenses for validation):

Lifecycle: How is ticket creation and deletion handled?

Thread-safety: Singleton and shared resources—will you need synchronization?

Delegation: Are entrance/exit gates doing too much or just enough?

Data access: Will repository abstraction be added now or later?

If you're satisfied with the design surface so far, you can proceed to class definitions or interaction design. Ready to move ahead?



You said:
so to keep it simple
in the main method
I will pass a vehicle to the entrance gate. as the parking manger will contain the parking lot and then  the manger will redirect the vehicle to the entrance gate and ticket will be created and sent the main method. will store will locally, and when required, will pass the ticket to the paking manager saying that this is the ticket. The manger will take the ticket and redirect to the exit gate.

Thread-safety: Yes i will have to use synchronization, as there an be multiple instance of the vhicel coming in.

Delegation: As far i know the entrance will have just have the method of liek searching or payment doing. but internally the buisness logic will be handled by the parking manager. Their are just kind of a application layer for the convinience.

Data access: For now repository will be added to contain the data structures and other parts to update.

And for now nothing will be well connected to run end-to-end.
Its just a surface level design which most of the interviewer ask for.
Correct?

Please let me know if this i what you req


ChatGPT said:
Yes — this is exactly in line with what’s expected at this level of low-level design in interviews.

You’ve:

Identified core flows (entry, allocation, exit, payment)

Cleanly abstracted responsibilities (e.g., Manager for orchestration, Gates for interface, Strategy for pricing)

Thought about extensibility (vehicle types, thread safety, repository layer)

Kept the system modular and layered (application layer vs business logic)

Clearly stated the level of completion (no need for full runnability)

You're focusing on the right things — surface-level design clarity, proper entity-role separation, and interaction flow. That's precisely what this phase is about.
